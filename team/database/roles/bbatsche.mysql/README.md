### Tuning Variables

MySQL of course has many settings in order to tweak its performance and resource usage. This role supports setting or calculating a handful of the most relevant ones.

- `mysql_mem_percent` &mdash; Percentage of total memory MySQL should use. This is by no means a cap, or really enforced, it's more a target used for calculating some of the other variables. Default is "40"

- `innodb_buffer_pool_size` &mdash; Amount of total memory to use for InnoDB buffer pool. Default is calculated based on `mysql_mem_percent` and `innodb_buffer_pool_percent`
- `innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size` &mdash; InnoDB buffer pool chunk size. Default is "128M"
- `mysql_key_buffer_percent` &mdash; Percentage of MySQL's memory to use for key buffer. Default is "40"

Example Playbook
----------------

Install a service (MariaDB):

```yml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
     - role: bbatsche.MySQL
       install_mariadb: yes
```

Create a new user (assuming a service is already installed and running):

```yml
- hosts: servers
  roles:
     - role: bbatsche.MySQL
       new_db_user: my_new_user
       new_db_pass: n0tV3ry$ecuRe
```

Testing
-------

Included with this role is a set of specs for testing each task individually or as a whole. To run these tests you will first need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. The spec files are written using [Serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) so you will need Ruby and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).

To run the full suite of specs:

```bash
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
$ rake
```

The spec suite will target Ubuntu Trusty Tahr (14.04), Xenial Xerus (16.04), and Bionic Bever (18.04).

To see the available rake tasks (and specs):

```bash
$ rake -T
```

These specs are **not** meant to test for idempotence. They are meant to check that the specified tasks perform their expected steps. Idempotency is tested independently via integration testing.
